                <p>Ferris Bueller once said <strong>"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."</strong></p>

                <p>It can be so easy to get engrossed in situations around that have fallen through and forget to show appreciation for the things that we have. One can only see the beauty of life and bask fully in it when an individual leads life on the path of gratitude and appreciation.</p>

                    1. Avoid being picky: appreciate everything.
                </h2>
                <p>More often than not, we tend to reserve gratitude for the things we connsider as "big". We forget that everything is indeed big and that the classification of events into big or small is relative to the individual. The habit of being grateful starts with appreciating every good thing in life and recognising that there is nothing too small for you to be grateful for.</p>

                <h2>2. Find gratitude in challenges and be mindful.</h2>
                <p>Gratitude  is  not  only  about  being  thankful  for  positive experiences.  In  fact,  sometimes thinking  about  negative or  difficult  situations  can help to really  nail  down what you  have  to  be thankful  for. It is advisable to take time out of the day to take inventory of about five to ten things to be thankful for. The trick  is  that you need  to  picture  it  in your  mind  and sit  with that  feeling  of  gratitude  in your  body.</p>
